<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Home advantage is the tendency of teams to perform better when
playing at home than when playing away. Home advantage has been
documented across many sports, including soccer, basketball, cricket,
hockey, rugby, and American football (<a
href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/home-field-advantage-facts-and-fiction">Chicago
Booth Review</a>).</p>
<p>In soccer, home advantage has been shown to exist in English, German,
Italian, French, and Spanish leagues. Home advantage was
greatly reduced in the 2020/21 season, when many matches were played
behind closed doors (i.e., without supporters in attendance) due to the
COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146902922100131X">Psychology of Sport and Exercise</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com">Fantasy Premier League</a> (FPL) is an online fantasy football game, in which
participants assemble virtual teams of Premier League
footballers and score points based on these players’ performances in Premier
League matches. Participants in FPL (managers) select a squad of 15
players within a budget and choose 11 players from the squad to play in each gameweek (where a "gameweek" corresponds roughly to a round of Premier League matches). Points
are scored for a variety of actions, including goals, assists, clean
sheets, and bonus points. Managers can make transfers and substitutions throughout the season.</p>
<p>It is conventional wisdom among FPL managers that, because home advantage exists in soccer at a team level, home advantage also exists in FPL at the level of individual players. In this short note, I describe some features of the FPL data. For a step-by-step description of what I did, see the corresponding <a href="/pages/2024-04-04-fpl-home-advantage-notebook">R notebook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
I use three datasets:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
href="https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League">Vaastav Anand’s
FPL Historical Dataset</a> for data on FPL player/gameweek pairs from 2016/17 through 2022/23.
  </li>
  <li>
    Match results from <a
href="http://www.football-data.co.uk"
class="uri">Football-Data.co.uk</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data on the number of managers per season from <a
href="https://allaboutfpl.com/2022/06/number-of-people-who-played-fpl-each-season-how-many-play-fpl/">allaboutfpl.com</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Findings</h2>
<h3 id="home-advantage">Home advantage</h3>

<p>Home advantage exists in FPL: players score more FPL points when
their team plays at home than when their team plays away. 
Setting aside 2020/21 and 2021/22, players score an average 
of 3.3-4.5 FPL points when playing at home and score only an average of 2.7-3.2 when playing away.
However, home advantage in FPL points was nonexistent in the 2020/21 season (when many matches were played without crowds) and continued to be lower than normal in 2021/22.</p>

  </center>
<p>Note that in the analysis above and in what follows, I exclude all
player/gameweek observations where <em>Percent selected by</em> is less
than 0.5%, i.e., where a player is selected in a particular gameweek by less than 0.5% of
participating managers. I make this exclusion because the FPL game includes
teams' full squads, which typically include many players (such as third
choice goalkeepers and youth players) who register very few minutes of
play, if any, during the course of a season. By excluding players with
low selection rates, I attempt to exclude these low-minutes players.
Additionally, players with low selection rates are not very relevant to
FPL.</p>

<p>Home advantage exists for all four player positions (goalkeeper,
defender, midfielder, and forward).</p>

<p>Almost all point-scoring actions in FPL contribute to home advantage
in total points. There are significant differences between home and away
matches in all plotted point-scoring actions except for red cards. (I
omit <em>Penalties missed</em> and <em>Penalties saved</em> from the
plot on account of their rarity.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the average number of minutes played (per
gameweek/player) is slightly higher for home games than for away games.
The difference is small, however—approximately 68.5 minutes for home
games vs 67.75 minutes for away games—and is therefore unlikely to be
meaningful for FPL points.</p>
<h2 id="do-fpl-managers-take-advantage-of-home-advantage">Do FPL
managers take advantage of home advantage?</h2>
<center>
<img src="images/mngr_selection_home_vs_away-1.png" alt="" />
</center>
<p>
Given that home advantage exists in FPL, we might expect FPL managers to be more likely to select players with home fixtures than players with away fixtures. However, the plot above indicates that this is not the case, at least for managers’ squad selection decisions: FPL managers are not more likely to select players with home fixtures than players with away fixtures.
</p>
<p>Of course, ideally, when assessing this question, we would also account for the selection of players in
each manager's <i>first team of 11 players</i> each gameweek, and not just the selection of players in the squad of 15 players.
</p><p>Every gameweek, managers must choose 11 players from their squad of 15 to “play” in that
gameweek (i.e., to score points for the maanger's team). The remaining four
players are on the manager’s “bench” and will only score points if one or more players from
the first team of 11 fails to register a single minute of play that
gameweek.</p>
<p>It seems likely that managers may account for home and away
fixtures in the playing/benching decisions more so than in their overall
squad selection decisions. Managers are restricted to a single ‘free’
transfer each gameweek—subsequent transfers cost 4 points each—meaning that
squads change slowly over time and players are typically held by
managers for multiple gameweeks (during which they will likely play both
home and away matches). Thus, it is potentially difficult for managers to take home and away fixtures into account when selecting players for their squads of 15.</p>

<p>However, our FPL dataset includes data only on
selection in the squad of 15 (our ‘Percent selected by’ variable) and
not on selection in each manager’s first 11 every gameweek.</p>
