<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>It is conventional wisdom among FPL managers that home advantage
exists in Fantasy Premier League (FPL). In this short note, I describe
the steps I took to demonstrate that this is indeed the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Home advantage exists in FPL: players score more FPL points when
their team plays at home than when their team plays away.</p></li>
<li><p>FPL home advantage disappeared entirely in the 2020/21
behind-closed-doors season, in line with team-level home
advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtually all FPL point-scoring actions exhibit home advantage
(positive actions occur more frequently at home, while negative actions
occur more frequently away). FPL home advantage exists across all player
positions (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="background-on-home-advantage">Background on home advantage</h3>
<p>Home advantage is the tendency of teams to perform better when
playing at home than when playing away. Home advantage is well
documented across many sports, including soccer, basketball, cricket,
hockey, rugby, and American football, among others (<a
href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/home-field-advantage-facts-and-fiction">Chicago
Booth Review</a>).</p>
<p>In soccer, home advantage has been shown to exist in English, German,
Italian, French, and Spanish leagues. Interestingly, home advantage was
greatly reduced in the 2020/21 season, when many matches were played
behind closed doors (i.e., without supporters in attendance) due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3 id="background-on-fantasy-premier-league">Background on Fantasy
Premier League</h3>
<p>Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online fantasy football, in which
participants assemble virtual teams of real-life Premier League
footballers and score points based on their performances in Premier
League matches. Participants in FPL (“managers”) select a squad of 15
players within a budget and choose 11 to play in each “gameweek”. Points
are scored for a variety of actions, including goals, assists, clean
sheets, and bonus points. Managers can make transfers and substitutions
to improve their teams throughout the season.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>I use data on FPL from 2016/17 through 2022/23. I make use of <a
href="https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League">Vaastav Anand’s
FPL Historical Dataset</a>.</p>
<p>I also use data on match results from <a
href="http://www.football-data.co.uk"
class="uri">http://www.football-data.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I use data on the number of managers per season from <a
href="https://allaboutfpl.com/2022/06/number-of-people-who-played-fpl-each-season-how-many-play-fpl/">allaboutfpl.com</a>.</p>

<p>Home advantage exists in FPL: players score more FPL points when
their team plays at home than when their team plays away. Interestingly,
FPL home advantage was nonexistent in 2020/21 and much lower than normal
in 2021/22. In other seasons, home advantage is reasonably consistent:
players score an average of 3.3-4.5 FPL points when playing at home but
score only an average of 2.7-3.2 when playing away.</p>
<p>Note that in the analysis above and in what follows, I exclude all
player/gameweek observations where <em>Percent selected by</em> is less
than 0.5%, i.e., where a player is selected by less than 0.5% of
participating managers. I make this exclusion because FPL includes
team’s full squads, which typically include many players (such as third
choice goalkeepers and youth players) who register very few minutes of
play, if any, during the course of a season. By excluding players with
low selection rates, I attempt to exclude these low-minutes players.
Additionally, players with low selection rates are not very relevant to
FPL.</p>

<p>Home advantage exists for all four player positions (goalkeeper,
defender, midfielder, and forward).</p>

<p>Almost all point-scoring actions in FPL contribute to home advantage
in total points. There are significant differences between home and away
matches in all plotted point-scoring actions except for red cards. (I
omit <em>Penalties missed</em> and <em>Penalties saved</em> from the
plot on account of their rarity.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the average number of minutes played (per
gameweek/player) is slightly higher for home games than for away games.
The difference is small, however—approximately 68.5 minutes for home
games vs 67.75 minutes for away games—and is therefore unlikely to be
meaningful for FPL points.</p>

managers take advantage of home advantage?</h2>

<p>FPL managers are not more likely to select players with home fixtures
than players with away fixtures.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would also account for the selection of players in
managers’ first team of 11 players each gameweek: every gameweek, a
manager must choose 11 players from the squad of 15 to “play” in that
gameweek (i.e., to score points for the team). The remaining four
players sit on the manager’s “bench” and will only score points if they
are automatically substituted, which happens if one or more players from
the first team of 11 fail to register a single minute of play that
gameweek. My guess is that managers may account for home and away
fixtures in the first 11 and bench decisions more so than in overall
squad selection decisions. Managers are restricted to a single ‘free’
transfer each gameweek—subsequent transfers cost 4 points—meaning that
squads change slowly over time and players are typically held by
managers for multiple gameweeks (during which they will likely play both
home and away matches). However, our FPL dataset includes data only on
selection in the squad of 15 (our ‘Percent selected by’ variable) and
not on selection in each manager’s first 11 every gameweek.</p>
